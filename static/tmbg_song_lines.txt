The day before they set out, they were contacted by a mysterious deranged millionaire, with a bold, artistic challenge. Write a new song every day, a song that would celebrate the unique character of each venue in which they performed, or else lose their magical song writing talisman, and leave Brooklyn forever vulnerable to his roving baseball gangs, and monstrous creatures. Ladies and gentlemen, I am that deranged millionaire, and I now present to you in what may be the last broadcast from They Might Be Giants studios before they are mine.

We started as um, like home taping enthusiasts.  We had uh, I had a four-track, uh, like a TI4 open-reel four track, and uh, John had a Moog synthesizer and we really started the band kind of, uh it revolved around us sharing equipment, so we were both making these home recordings that were kind of for ourselves, they were really, uh, lopsided, kind of awkward, uh you know, stabs at, you know, art rock, and, um, uh, you know, pretty unlistenable stuff for awhile, but uh, but you know it was, we started playing on each other's recordings, and, and uh, you know, sort of worked together more that way, and um, so, in someways there's something essentially untraditional about just the very begin, from the very beginning about our, our take on what it is to be a band, and then um, being in New York in that beginning moment of, of like Hip-Hop culture where drum machines were really dominant on the radio, uh, we, we, we got, um, we got a very inexpensive, well actually, our first recordings we basically, um, were using the synthisizer to kind of recreate the sounds of the drum machine because we couldn't... drum machines were really expensive, um, so we would , uh, you know, make these rhythm tracks and then we would play, you know, clubs in the East Village, uh, to these uh, pre-recorded tracks, and uh, it was all very uh, it's all very sort of New Wave/Art School kind of uh, stuff, but it was a lot of fun.", u'Well, you know, you mentioned Hip Hop , and, and, and the Punk Rock scene as well, there was a strong DIY quality to it.', u"Exactly.

No, no , no, that doesn\'t happen."', u'They were like, "It\'s over. The whole thing is over.  Sorry, guys the scene just ended."', u'So, rather than bring you guys in, they just decided to go belly up.', u'Yeah, yeah. The whole New York New Wave scene just basically folded up when we were came, hit the...', u'And, and so, what, what was the very first They Might Be Giants gig?', u'Our very first show was a duo.', u"Well, yeah.  We did, we did a show in Central Park with, uh,um, without a name basically. We just um, wanted to play some of the songs we'd written, and a friend of ours got us a gig which was just performing at this rally of a coalition, uh in support of the, um, Sandonista... you know, it was something like the third anniversary of the Sandonistas, so they had this enormous SFLN banner and everyone spoke in Spanish from the stage, and they introduced us as El Gruppa De Rock and Roll, and um, and we came out and did these songs which were utterly unrelated and incongruous, but you know I mean surprisingly the crowd was in to it, you know.

Um, but then, like actually playing for, you know, like a crowd in a bar, we really didn't know how, the, the, what we were doing would be perceived, and just like speaking of like the new wave thing, you know we were doing these kind of wierd songs, but we thought they were much more messed up, and, and, in...inpenetrable, and then immediately as we were playing, you know, people kind of started laughing, and sort of like a gently amused, sort of knowing way.", u'Uh, huh', u"And, and it wasn't, I don't think, you know, we'd spent like a good month putting the show together.
