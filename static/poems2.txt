Joseph O. Legaspi|At the Bridal Shop|The gowns and dresses hang|like fleece in their glaring|whiteness, sheepskin-softness,|the ruffled matrimonial love in which the brides-|in-waiting dance around, expectantly,|hummingbirds to tulips.   I was dragged here:|David’s Bridal, off the concrete-gray arterial|highways of a naval town.   I sink into the flush|bachelors’ couch, along with other men sprinkled|throughout the shop, as my friend and her female compatriots parade|taffeta dresses in monstrous shades of pastels—persimmons,|lilacs, periwinkles—the colors of weddings and religious|holidays.   Trains drag on the floor, sleeves drape|like limp, pressed sheets of candied fruits,|ribbons fluttering like pale leaves.   I watch|families gathered together: the women, like worshippers,|circling around the smiling brides-to-be, as if they were|the anointed ones.   The men, in turn, submerge|deeper into couches, into sleep, while the haloed,|veiled women cannot contain their joy,|they flash their winning smiles, and they are beautiful.
Miller  Williams|Going Deaf|No matter how she tilts her head to hear|she sees the irritation in their eyes.|She knows how they can read a small rejection,|a little judgment, in everyWhat did you say?|So now she doesn’t sayWhat?orCome again?|She lets the syllables settle, hoping they form|some sort of shape that she might recognize.|When they don’t, she smiles with everyone else,|and then whoever was talking turns to her|and says, “Break wooden coffee, don’t you know?”|She pulls all she can focus into the face|to know if she ought to nod or shake her head.|In that long space her brain talks to itself.|The person may turn away as an act of mercy,|leaving her there in a room full of understanding|with nothing to cover her, neither sound nor silence.
Gerald  Fleming|Long Marriage|You’re worried, so you wake her|& you talk into the dark:|Do you think I have cancer, you|say, orWere there worms|in that meat, orDo you think|our son is OK, and it’s|wonderful, really—almost|ceremonial as you feel|the vessel of your worry pass|miraculously from you to her—|Gee, the rain sounds so beautiful,|you say—I’m going back to sleep.
William  Trowbridge|Long Distance to My Old Coach|The reception's not bad, across 50 years,|though his voice has lost its boot-camp timbre.|He's in his 80's now and, in a recent photo,|looks it, so bald and pale and hard to see behind|the tallowing of flesh. Posing with friends,|he's the only one who has to sit—the man|three of us couldn't pin. "The Hugger,"|they christened him before my class arrived—|for his bearlike shape and his first name, Hugh.|He fostered even us, the lowly track squad.|"Mr. Morrison," I still call him. "You were|the speedster on the team, a flash," he recalls|with a chuckle. That's where his memory of me|fades. And what have I retained of him beyond|the nickname, voice, and burly shape? The rest|could be invention: memory and desire's|sleight-of-hand as we call up those we think|we've known, to chat about the old days|and the weather, bum hips and cholesterol,|our small talk numbing as a dial tone,|serious as prayer.
Freya   Manfred|This Stranger, My Husband|The older we get the stranger my husband becomes,|and the less certain I am that I know him.|We used to lie eye to eye, breathing together|in the immensity of each moment.|Lithe and starry-eyed, we could leap fences|even with babies on our backs.|His eyes still dream off|toward something in the distance I can't see;|but now he gazes more zealously,|and leaps into battle with a more certain voice|over politics, religion, or art,|and some old friends won't come to dinner.|The molecules of our bodies spiral off into the stars|on winds of change and chance,|as we welcome the unknown, the incalculable,|the spirit and heart of everything we named and knew so well—|and never truly named, or knew,|but only loved, at last.
Joan  Graham |The Day After Labor Day|September breeze, an island chill,|the streets so quiet . . . still,|seem wider now|but soon they fill|with gulls|that stride and squawk|and boldly walk|the middle of the road—|I wish I understood|gull-talk|perhaps they, too, feel harmony|no crowds, no noise|now once again|just sand, waves, sky, and sea|. . . just gulls and me
Joan  Graham |Nature Knows Its Math|Divide|the year|into seasons,|four,|subtract|the snow then|add|some more|green,|a bud,|a breeze,|a whispering|behind|the trees,|and here|beneath the|rain-scrubbed|sky|orange poppies|multiply.

Eileen  Spinelli |Suprise|“I'm so—”|I start to apologize,|but Albert laughs.|“It's not my birthday,”|he says.|I'm confused.|“It's foryou, Bindi.”|“Me?” I say. “It's not|my birthday, either.”|Albert leads me to the chair.|He hands me the present.|I open it.|It's one of those|plastic trophy things.|It says: “World's Best Sister.”|I get all choked up.|“I'm really proud of you,”|says Albert.|“You are?”|“Totally. You came through|a really rough time, Bindi.”|“Not always with flying colors,”|I say.|“True, but you never gave up.”|“I thought I did, sometimes.|And you went to all this trouble?”|Albert shrugs. “It's what brothers do.”|Albert's grandmother pops her head in.|I look up.|Megan and Kyra are in the doorway,|smiling.|Mrs. Poole leads us all|over to the table.|The message on the cake reads:|“Bravo to Our Bindi!”|“Wow!” says Kyra.|Megan turns to Albert.|“Need another sister?”
Jen  Bryant |And Later . . .|I take my kaleidoscope off the shelf,|look through the little hole at the end|of the cardboard tube;|I turn       and turn       and turn       and turn,|letting the crystals shift into strange|and beautiful patterns, letting the pieces fall|wherever they will.

Pat  Mora|Old Love|When my aunt died,|my uncle raised his hands|like a prophet in the Bible.|“I've lost my girl,” he said,|“I've lost my girl,” over and over,|shaking his head.|I didn't know what to say,|where to look,|my quiet uncle raising his voice|to silence.|My aunt was eighty-seven.|“Listen,” my uncle said, sighing|like a tree alone at night,|“women know.|Every midnight on New Year's Eve,|when others sang|and laughed and hugged,|your aunt looked at me,|tears in her eyes.|Sixty years.|She knew.|One day, we'd kiss good-bye.”
Pat  Mora|Ode to Teachers|I remember|the first day,|how I looked down,|hoping you wouldn't see|me,|and when I glanced up,|I saw your smile|shining like a soft light|from deep inside you.|“I'm listening,” you encourage us.|“Come on!|Join our conversation,|let us hear your neon certainties,|thorny doubts, tangled angers,”|but for weeks I hid inside.|I read and reread your notes|praising|my writing,|and you whispered,|“We need you|and your stories|and questions|that like a fresh path|will take us to new vistas.”|Slowly, your faith grew|into my courage|and for you—|instead of handing you|a note or apple or flowers—|I raised my hand.|I carry your smile|and faith inside like I carry|my dog's face,|my sister's laugh,|creamy melodies,|the softness of sunrise,|steady blessings of stars,|autumn smell of gingerbread,|the security of a sweater on a chilly day.
Linda  Bierds|Prologue|They darken. In the sky over Florence,|the oblong clouds swell and darken.|And hailstones lift back through the updrafts,|thickening, darkening, until, swollen as bird eggs,|they drop to the cobbled streets.|Horses!the child Galileo thinks, then|peeks through the doorway|to the shock of ten thousand icy hooves.|At his back, his father is tuning violins,|and because there is nothing sharper at hand|Galileo saws through a captured hailstone|with a length of E-string,|the white globe opening slowly, and the pattern inside|already bleeding its frail borders.|Layers and layers of ice—|Like what? Onion pulp? Cypress rings?|If only the room were colder, and the eye|finer. If only the hand were faster,|and the blade sharper, and firmer,|and without a hint of song . . .
Linda  Bierds|The Highland|—Zelda Fitzgerald, 1939|Dear One,|Do you have the time? Can you take|the time? Can you make|the time?|To visit me? The hospital doors have opened to spring,|and its landishigh, dear one, each slope|with a vapor of crocuses. Its citizens, alas,|are low. Despondent, in fact, though a jar of sun tea|tans on the sill. The woman beside me|has opened the gift of a china doll, an antique|Frozen Charlotte. Glass face, a cap of china hair,|shellacked to the sheen of a chestnut.|At breakfast the shifting returned, dreadful|within me:colors were infinite, part of the air. . .|lines were free of the masses they held. The melon,|a cloud; and the melon, an empty,|oval lariat.|They have moved the canvas chair|from the window. Sun, enhanced|by the brewing jar, threw|an apricot scorch on the fabric. The fruit,|a cloud. The fruit,|a doll-sized, empty lariat.|D. O., into what shape|will our shaplessness flow?|||Dear One,|Italian escapes me. Still, I float to the operas|of Hasse and Handel, a word now and then|lifting through . . .sole,libertà. In an earlier time,|the thrum-plumped voice of a countertenor—half male,|half female—might place him|among us, we who are thickened|by fracturings. D. O., now and then, my words|break free of the masses they hold.|Think of wind, how it barks through the reeds|of a dog's throat. How the pungent, meaty stream of it|cracks into something like words—but not. I just sit|in the sun room then, slumped in my fur and slabber,|feeling the wolf begin, back away, then some|great-jawed, prehistoric other|begin, back away, then the gill-less,|the gilled, then the first pulsed flecks|begin, back away, until only a wind remains,|vast and seamless. No earth, no heavens.|No rise, no dip. No single flash of syllable|that might be me. Or you.|||D. O.,|Now a gauze of snow on the crocuses! I woke|to its first brilliance—midnight, great moon—|and walked through the hallways. The pin-shaped leaves|of the potted cosmos threw a netted shadow,|and I stopped in its fragile harmony,|my arms, bare feet, the folds of my limp gown|striped by such weightless symmetry|I might have been|myself again. Through an open screen door|I saw a patient, drawn out by the brightness perhaps,|her naked body a ghastly white, her face|a ghastly, frozen white, fixed|in a bow-mouthed syncope, like something|out of time. As we are, D. O., here|in the Highland, time's infinite, cyclic now-and-then|one simple flake of consciousness|against the heated tongue.|||Dear One,|My Italian improves:|sole,libertà,|andDio, of course, D. O.! (Although He|has forsaken me.) The tea at the window|gleams like the flank of a chestnut horse. It darkens|imperceptibly, as madness does, or dusk.|All morning, I held a length of cotton twine—|a shaggy, oakum filament—|between the jar and brewing sun.|We made a budding universe: the solar disc,|the glassy globe of reddish sea, the stillness|in the firmament. At last across the cotton twine|a smoke began, a little ashless burn, Dio,|that flared and died so suddenly|its light has yet to reach me.
Linda  Bierds|For the Sake of Retrieval|As Whistler heard colors like a stretch of music—|long harmonies, violet to amber, double hummings of|silver, opal—so, in reverse, these three in their capsule,|free falling two hours through the black Atlantic, ears|popped, then filled with the music of Bach or Haydn,|might fashion a landscape. Low notes bring|a prairie perhaps, the sharps a smatter of flowers,|as the pip notes of sonar spring back to the screen|in little blossoms. They have come for the lostTitanic|and find instead, in the splayed beam of a headlamp,|silt fields, pale and singluar, like the snow fields|of Newfoundland.  On its one runner blade the capsule slides,|slips out through drift hummocks, through|stones the Ice Age glaciers dropped, its trail|the foot-thin trail of a dancer, who|plants, glides, at his head the flurry|of a ship's chandelier, at his back a cinch-hook of icebergs|cast down through the winds of Newfoundland.|The music these three absorb|stops with the wreckage, with words|lipped up through a microphone:|flange,windlass,capstan,hull plating, then oddly, syllables|at a slant, as light might slant through window slats,|stairsteps,doorknob,serving bowl,teacup,Bordeaux.|Mechanical fingers, controlled by the strokes|of a joy stick, brush over debris, lifting, replacing.|In jittery strobe lights, camera lights, all colors|ground down to a quiet palette,|angles return, corners and spirals|pull back to the human eye—as if from some|iced and black-washed atmosphere, boiler coal,|a footboard and platter, each common shape|brightened, briefly held for the sake of retrieval.|The current spins silt like a sudden storm.|With the intricacy of a body the capsule adjusts,|temperature, pressure. Someone coughs, then the three|sit waiting, as in Whistler'sSad Sea|three are waiting. All around them are dollops|of winter wind, everywhere beach and sea. No horizon|at all in this painting, just a grey/brown thrum|beach to sea. How steady his breath must have been|on the canvas, his hands on the brushstrokes|of lap robes, of bonnets and beach chairs, the pull|of a red umbrella: each simple shape|loved and awash in the landscape.
Linda  Bierds|Wonders|In a wide hoop of lamplight, two children—|a girl and her younger brother—jump marbles|on a star-shaped playboard. Beside them,|in a chair near a window, their father|thinks of his mother, her recent death|and the grief he is trying to gather.|It is late October. The hooplight spreads|from the family, through the window,|to the edge of a small orchard, where|a sudden frost has stripped the fruit leaves|and only apples hang, heavy and still|on the branches.|The man looks from the window, down|to a scrapbook of facts he is reading.|The spider is proven to have memory, he says,|and his son, once again, cocks his small face|to the side, speaks a guttural oh, as if|this is some riddle he is slowly approaching,|as if this long hour, troubled with phrases|and the queer turn in his father's voice,|is offered as a riddle.|There is the sound of marbles|in their suck-hole journeys, and the skittery|jump of the girl's shoe|as she waits, embarrassed, for her father|to stop, to return to his known self, thick|and consistent as a family bread.|But still he continues,|plucking scraps from his old book, old|diary of wonders: the vanishing borders|of mourning paper, the ghostly shape|in the candled egg, beak and eye|etched clearly, a pin-scratch of claw.|A little sleet scrapes at the window.|The man blinks, sees his hand on the page|as a boy's hand, sees his children bent over|the playboard, with the careful pattern|of their lives dropping softly away, like|leaves in a sudden frost—how the marbles|have stalled, heavy and still on their fingers,|and after each phrase the guttural|oh, and the left shoe jumping.
Lia  Purpura|Solitude|No one home.|Snow packing|the morning in.|Much white|nothing filling up.|A V of birds|pulling|the silence|until some dog|across the street|barks, and breaks|what I call my peace.|What a luxury|annoyance is.|It bites off|and keeps|just enough of|what I think|I want to be endless.
Lia  Purpura|Rare Moment|A clear choice|is so sweet. Not|reluctance but|realresistance.|Joy-to-bursting,|or none.|Grief,|not gradations.|Someone essential|and someone not.|A good, dark|strike-through|versus|weighing everything|at the end of each day.|Look, a cat killed a cardinal|on an emerald lawn.|For so many reasons|it shouldn't have been|beautiful.|But that's also|the kind of book|I like best.
Lia  Purpura|Beginning|In the beginning,|in the list of begats,|one begat|got forgot:|work begets work|(one poem|bears|the next).|In other words,|once there was air,|a bird|could be got.|Not taken.|Not kept.|But conjured up.
Lia  Purpura|Some Beauty|Its nature|is ruthless, nothing|as simple as|loss being ruinous,|those undeniable rainbows|of oil, shock of bright|sulphurous puddles|(in goldfinch, in lemon)|and now what,|if that beauty's|terrible plumage|makes you keep looking|and disturbs your despair.
Cate  Marvin|Flowers, Always|Inexplicable, the sign outside a deli scrawled|with FLOWERS|and below that: ALWAYS.|But there were no flowers. And I have never|seen an Always. I would like to,|and I have looked.|I have kept my eye keen|for Always, have liked|its idea like an expensive purse, coveting it as|it appears,|riding the arms of rich ladies who are|so very lady.                      I've rolled on velvet|cushions where I heard Always slept,|and I once tried to kiss Always,|but I don't think it was the Always|I was looking for.|I like your Always, it looks|such a demanding pet. It looks like it kisses|nice and soft.|It looks like the bruise I found|flowering on my knee.|I fell down at your voice.|Not to worry, I got right back up, walked ten|more blocks|and by then I was halfway home.|I knock my knees blue|and scabbed crawling|toward you, wanting flowers,|and always, always, always|to slide against the cold vinyl of a car's seat,|your pale hands|on the bare backs of my legs,|that's one Always I want, and whoever knew|there were so many species|of Always? Your bare hands|on the pale backs|of my thighs, printing bruise,|and if you saidFlowers, saidAlwaysand we|could erect a forever|of something like sheets|and breakfast and an ordinary|day, my eyes would|always slide across the table toward|you,|to warm their twin marbles in your palm,|my face would flower|for you daily, so that when we|die, roses might petal|themselves out our throats.
Cate  Marvin|A Brief Attachment|I regard your affections, find your teeth have|left me a bruise necklace. Those lipstick|marks leech a trail, ear to ear, facsimile your|smile. Your 40 ounces of malt liquor, your|shrink hate, your eyes dialing 911. The hearts|you draw with ballpoint on my cigarette packs|when I've left the room, penned in your girl's|cursive, look demented, misshapen approximations|of what I refuse to hand over. It's a nice touch,|though: a little love to accompany the cancer.|My thought follows you to where you spend|your days lying in bed, smoking and reading|the Beats. The accumulation of clothes and ashes|circles you, rising like a moat after rainfall.|Often you are a study in detachment—the trigger|eye is your eye, still as a finger poised to press|should one refuse to cooperate, and I wonder|how you can hate men so much when you think|like one. Think of what I could be doing outside|if I could unlock the door of myself: think bikini,|think soda fountain, think tradition, a day lacking|entirely your brand of ambivalence. If you were|a number, I'd subtract you; if you were a sentence,|I'd rewrite you. Are you the one who left these|wilted flowers, are you the one whose PIN spells|out H-O-L-E? Why are you wearing my clothes?|If you are weather, then I am a town, closing down|at word of your coming: you're a glacier on fast|forward, you're direct as a detour, when I say|good-bye you move in next door. You say you|want to have my baby, you want to buy me a car,|and you're too young to enter a bar. I should tether|you to a tree in the dark park, allow the moon to stroke|your white neck. I should give you a diamond collar,|walk you around the block and show you off.
Cate  Marvin|After the Last Fright|I carved upon my desk unsayables.|He drank until he vomited on himself.|Eavesdropping, the others resisted sleep.|The house knew the pain of sun on lacquered floorboards.|I carved it with the tips of scissors.|A door creaked; he hung his head into the room.|Please, the others cannot sleep.|The shingles twitched like skin beneath moonlight.|I spent the afternoon at a movie theater.|He staggered through brush toward a pay phone.|The others continued searching the streets for him.|The house held the moon above it, it was that imperial.|I recall the room was empty when I came back in.|He was arrested at the Quik-Trip while calling collect.|Frantic, the others circled the block again.|The house was ghost-white, older than the dead.|I needle-pointed for 72 hours straight.|He claimed the whole situation humiliated him.|Relieved, the others refrained from asking him what jail was like.|The house was swan to field, tiger to sea.|I lay in bed by the time the others came home.|He couldn't recall putting on the orange jumpsuit.|The others asked if I'd seen him around.|The house shuddered,No-o-o-o.|The house winced, winked its blinds.|The house whispered I should stay inside.|The others flew out the doors and into their cars.|The others slammed their cars into deer and cried.|He was more humiliated than he'd ever been.|He looked more or less the same, though his eyes were ringed.|The others hid in the basement.|He climbed the stairs and presented a ring.|The house swung its windows wide to ice.|He banged his nails blue, pinned his tongue to his tie.|He packed himself in a box, sent it to regions far off.|The others pressed their ears to the pipes.|The house wore its flames like a hat.|The house called a radio talk-show.|We drank all night, laughed all night, the night he left.|I shook in its mouth till the house drank me up.
Cate  Marvin|The Pet|I rode him through the village, smiling.|He tossed his tasseled mane in distress.|The villagers took his gesture as vanity,|and made no attempt to rein him back.|Camped at night by stream and fire,|he seemed to think stories were in order.|The ghoulish tales twisting out his mouth|no longer frightened me. On leaving,|I'd taken on a certain complacency. Later,|he'd characterize my silence as merely|mean. But what is mean about a mouth|that, having no stories, claims it can provide|no flower for the ear, no wine for the wind?|I tried: I told the tale of him, which he|(the version being mine) was not much|interested in. But all of us, the fattening|moon, the yewey trees, the sharp-toothed|stars who combed their glowing backs against|the sky like cats: we laughed. And now|that I had left, where would I take him?|He was vehicle and, as such, responsibility.|He was deadening, tiresome, and necessary.|I made ourselves a home and kept him gently|as a pet. Visitors often wonder aloud,|How do you manage to keep such a creature|inside? The floors are stained with his keep.|I tell them my heart is huge and its doors|are small. Once I took him in he grew. Now|I cannot remove him without killing him,|which, frankly, I have never wanted to do.
Cate  Marvin|Anathema|I never recline in splendor,|I never take repose. The eyes|of an old woman are blue|and stick to me like insects to|a screen. She is not hating me,|though there are those who hate me,|so I never lie in repose for fear|that if I agree with the vulnerability|of sleep, I'll make my own murder.|I don't embrace the unconscious|or analyze my dreams. The eyes|of people who hate me might be|spiders crawling on my hands,|or snails that leave their shells,|but I will not allow their acidic|tounges to touch me. I belive|in ghosts only now that her blue|eyes stick to me like humidity.|I will not outgrow my spite,|though I read books that instruct|me to. No, I'll always lie with my|sleep beside me like a knife.|I forgot my spite, once, only|to wish I had not: He lay me|upon the bed, crossed my arms|across my chest, then fell to me,|pressing a book between us.|I never lie in repose. I am not|a portrait. But I think so still|my joints ache. One day, he|shall not be the same (as I have|never been the same), and we|shall read upon his stone a verse|attributed to my name. This|is my foresight and my fright,|blooming red in his eye's white.
Cate  Marvin|Landscape Without You|Roofers scrape the scaly lid|of an auto shop beside the house|where I live. Where I live|shirtless men tear at the black|scabs of a roof's old flesh, toss|scraps into the back of a truck|parked in the lot next to a house|where I live. Where I live|a tarp rattles at night, plastic|rustles, and trash is kicked along|pavement by wind. Roofers|curse and shell the tire shop's|peeling lid beside the house|where I live. Where I live|a tarp shakes all night; cans|land on pavement, tossed from|windows of cars that blur by|where I live. Where I live|windows are ladled red with|light your sun leaves me with.|Repairs are made to roofs which|will never cover me. As I read|the road between us, tire tracks|unscroll their tawdry calligraphy.|Any day now you shall arrive, roar|into my eye with your mountainside.|Where I live when I live where|landscape cannot survive you.
Cate  Marvin|On Parting|Before I go let me thank the man who mugs you,|taking your last paycheck, thank the boss who steals|your tips, thank the women who may break you.|I thank the pens that run out on you midsentence,|the flame that singes your hair, the ticket you can't|use because it's torn. Let me thank the stars|that remind you the eyes that were stars are now|holes. Let me thank the lake that drowns you, the sun|that makes your face old. And thank the street your car|dies in. And thank the brother you find unconcious|with bloody arms, thank the needle that assists in|doing him in—so much a part of you. No thanks|to the skin forgetting the hands it welcomed, your|hands refusing to recall what they happend upon.|How blessed is the body you move in—how gone.

John  Murillo|Upon Reading That Eric Dolphy Transcribed Even the Calls of Certain Species of Birds,|I think first of two sparrows I met when walking home,|late night years ago, in another city, not unlike this — the one|bird frantic, attacking I thought, the way she swooped|down, circled my head, and flailed her wings in my face;|how she seemed to scream each time I swung; how she|dashed back and forth between me and a blood-red Corolla|parked near the opposite curb; how, finally, I understood:|I spied another bird, also calling, its foot inexplicably|caught in the car’s closed door, beating its whole bird|body against it. Trying, it appeared, to bang himself free.|And who knows how long he’d been there, wailing. Who|knows — he and the other I mistook, at first, for a bat.|They called to me — something between squawk and chirp,|something between song and prayer — to do something,|anything. And, like any good god, I disappeared. Not|indifferent, exactly. But with things to do. And, most likely,|on my way home from another heartbreak. Call it 1997,|and say I’m several thousand miles from home. By which|I mean those were the days I made of everyone a love song.|By which I mean I was lonely and unrequited. But that’s|not quite it either. Truth is, I did manage to find a few|to love me, but couldn’t always love them back. The Rasta|law professor. The firefighter’s wife. The burlesque dancer|whose daughter blackened drawings withms to mean|the sky was full of birds the day her daddy died. I think|his widow said he drowned one morning on a fishing trip.|Anyway, I’m digressing. But if you asked that night —|did I mention it was night? — why I didn’t even try|to jimmy the lock to spring the sparrow, I couldn’t say,|truthfully, that it had anything to do with envy, with wanting|a woman to plead as deeply for me as these sparrows did,|one for the other. No. I’d have said something, instead,|about the neighborhood itself, the car thief shot a block|and a half east the week before. Or about the men|I came across nights prior, sweat-slicked and shirtless,|grappling in the middle of the street, the larger one’s chest|pressed to the back of the smaller, bruised and bleeding|both. I know you thought this was about birds,|but stay with me. I left them both in the street —|the same street where I’d leave the sparrows — the men|embracing and, for all one knows (especially one not|from around there), they could have been lovers —|the one whispering an old, old tune into the ear|of the other —Baby, baby, don’t leave me this way. I left|the men where I’d leave the sparrows and their song.|And as I walked away, I heard one of the men call to me,|pleaseorhelporbrotheror some such. And I didn’t break|stride, not one bit. It’s how I’ve learned to save myself.|Let me try this another way. Call it 1977. And say|I’m back west, South Central Los Angeles. My mother|and father at it again. But this time in the street,|broad daylight, and all the neighbors watching. One,|I think his name was Sonny, runs out from his duplex|to pull my father off. You see where I’m going with this?|My mother crying out, fragile as a sparrow. Sonny|fighting my father, fragile as a sparrow. And me,|years later, trying to get it all down. As much for you —|I’m saying — as for me. Sonny catches a left, lies flat|on his back, blood starting to pool and his own|wife wailing. My mother wailing, and traffic backed,|now, half a block. Horns, whistles, and soon sirens.|1977. Summer. And all the trees full of birds. Hundreds,|I swear. And since I’m the one writing it, I’ll tell you|they were crying. Which brings me back to Dolphy|and his transcribing. The jazzman, I think, wanted only|to get it down pure. To get it down exact — the animal|racking itself against a car’s steel door, the animals|in the trees reporting, the animals we make of ourselves|and one another. Stay with me now. Don’t leave me.|Days after the dustup, my parents took me to the park.|And in this park was a pond, and in this pond were birds.|Not sparrows, but swans. And my father spread a blanket|and brought from a basket some apples and a paring knife.|Summertime. My mother wore sunglasses. And long sleeves.|My father, now sober, cursed himself for leaving the radio.|But my mother forgave him, and said, as she caressed|the back of his hand, that we could just listen to the swans.|And we listened. And I watched. Two birds coupling,|one beating its wings as it mounted the other. Summer,|1977. I listened. And watched. When my parents made love|late into that night, I covered my ears in the next room,|scanning the encyclopedia for swans. It meant nothing to me —|then, at least — but did you know the collective noun|for swans is alamentation? And is a lamentation not|its own species of song? What a woman wails, punch drunk|in the street? Or what a widow might sing, learning her man|was drowned by swans? A lamentation of them? Imagine|the capsized boat, the panicked man, struck about the eyes,|nose, and mouth each time he comes up for air. Imagine|the birds coasting away and the waters suddenly calm.|Either trumpet swans or mutes. The dead man’s wife|running for help, crying to any who’d listen. A lamentation.|And a city busy saving itself. I’m digressing, sure. But|did you know that to digress means to stray from the flock?|When I left my parents’ house, I never looked back. By which|I mean I made like a god and disappeared. As when I left|the sparrows. And the copulating swans. As when someday|I’ll leave this city. Its every flailing, its every animal song.

One lay across the tracks|on the brink of the Tiananmen uprising. One picked up her manuscript, a block of ash,|from the embers of her Oakland home. Bakhtin, as we know,|smoked his very best pages in prison. The poems of Radnóti were found by his widow in|his overcoat, in a mass grave. One scribbled until his last|conscious breath in an apartment in Waltham, brimmed over with hellish fury and|dysfunctional passion.

Can houses tremble?|Do you have a sex life?|H: None of your business.

Sharon  Olds|The Relics|1.brett returns my mother to the wilderness|I slipped them into my friend’s palm —|the tiny crucifix, and dove,|from off my mother’s pendant watch —|and I asked her to walk them up through the brush|toward timberline, and find a place|to hurl them, for safekeeping. Now,|she writes, “I walked up the canyon at dusk,|warm, with a touch of fall blowing down the canyon,|came to an outcrop, above a steep|drop — far below, a seasonal|creek, green willows. I stood on a boulder|and held out my hand. I wished your mother all the|love in the world, and I sent the talismans|flying off the cliff. They were so small,|and the wind was blowing, so I never saw or|heard them land.” My mother is where|I cannot find her, she is gone beyond|recall, she lies in her sterling shapes|light as the most weightless bone in the body, her|stirrup bone, which was ground up|and sown into the sea. I do not know|what a soul is, I think of it|as the smallest, the core, civil right. And she|is wild now with it, she touches and is|touched by no one knows — down, or|droppings of a common nighthawk,|root of bird’s foot fern, antenna of|Hairstreak or Echo Azure, or stepped on by the|huge translucent Jerusalem cricket. There was|something deeply right about|the physical elements — atoms, and cells,|and marrow — of my mother’s body,|when I was young, and now her delicate|insignias receive the direct|touch of the sun, and scatter it,|unseen, all over her home.|2.cross and dove|2.cross and dove|I had not wanted them, and I hadn’t known|what to do with them, the minuscule|symbols of my mother’s religion,|I looked for a crack in the stone floor of the|cathedral but could not find one. Then I thought|of the wilderness near Desolation,|and asked my friend to carry them up|to a peak of granite, and let the wind take them. Since|then, it has been as if my mother’s|spirit matter has been returned|into the great bank of matter,|as her marrow had been sifted down into|the ocean. It doesn’t matter, now, if I|ever wanted to disassemble|my mother. The sixteenth-of-an-inch-|across cross, and the silver line drawing|of a dove are cached, somewhere, that is nowhere|to be found. Now I think of the nature of metal, and how|long the soul-dolls of her trust will last in their|spider-egg-sac of roots, needles,|quartz, feathers, dust, snow, shed|claw. Her belief she would have an eternal|life was absolute, I think.|It would not be good to think of my mother|without her God — like a hermit howling in the|moonscape of a desert. Once, when she was old — like an|exquisite child playing a crone|in the school play — we talked about heaven.|She wasn’t sure exactly how, but she|knew her father would be there, and her elder|brother, and her second husband —|maybe it was a heaven for four,|the three men and her. It was so|easy to make my mother happy|in her last years, to tell her that I|could just see her, as a kitten, in God’s|lap, being petted. Her eyes sparkled with more|beams than any other eyes I have seen.|I have sent the tokens of her everlasting being|into the high altitude.|They will shine long after I can sing her — sing what I|perceived through the distorted prisms of my vision.|I don’t know if I saw my mother|or did not see her. Day and night,|her charms will gleam in the brush or stream, will|reflect the mountain light in little|pieces of unreadable language.
Paisley  Rekdal|The Wolves|It was the week of asking. Asking|to watch her eat. Asking if she understood|the doctors’ questions. Asking her|to explain the difference between|wanting to die right now, and dying later.|The tumor making certain answers|unquestionable. I watched her point|to the incense dish from which|someone swept all the ashes up. Asking|if she recognized us. Because that|is what the living want: thinking|it is a sign we have been loved.|But the answer was a summer drive,|a mountain, piles of leaves beneath which|a wolf slept, suckling her cubs.|Some deaths are good|and it makes them hard to grieve.|She was, at times, in great pain. We wanted her|to die, too. That was important. But first|we wanted her to remember.|From the bed, a finger pressed|into a pile of leaves. Gray haunch,|unmovable ashes.I didn’t want to disturb|their tableau, she told us. And drifted off. And|we did not know the meaning behind this.|The wolves must have looked so comfortable|to her: wordless and in this wordlessness|perfect. Did she want to go there, too.|I could point to the image and say, my father|must be in there, my uncle. Or:|the wolf is you, you are still the mother,|as if necessary to name that self|at the end of its world. An animal cry,|memory. That was our selfishness.|As death was hers. She insisted upon it.|And why not.It was good for me|to get a chance to know you,|she said, who had known me|my entire life. Then the pills, a small|handful, crushed into juice.|She was happy then. We all were. Or|said we were. What|is the difference now.
